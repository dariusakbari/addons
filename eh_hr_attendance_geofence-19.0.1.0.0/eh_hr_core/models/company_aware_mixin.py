"""eh.hr.company.aware.mixin - strict multi-company safety.

OpenHRMS leaks null-company records across companies via global ir.rules with
``company_id = False``.  We refuse that pattern:

    * On create, ``company_id`` defaults to ``self.env.company`` and is required.
    * On write, attempts to change ``company_id`` to a company the user is not
      a member of are rejected - even by sudo, unless the explicit context
      key ``allow_cross_company`` is set AND audited.
    * The mixin emits an audit row for any cross-company elevation.
